          Empire Funded Standard Accounts are traditional evaluation-type
          trading. These accounts are split between 2-Step and 1-Step phases.
          Passing these phases will promote your account to the Funded stage
          where you can earn real payouts. These accounts are designed for
          beginners to test consistency, risk management and strategy while
          allowing them to place significant capital on the line. <br />

          The Profit Target represents the total gain required to pass each

          based on the <strong>initial account balance.</strong>
          <br />

          The Profit Target for all phases on both 2-Step and 1-Step Challenge
          accounts is 6%.

          <br />
          The Profit Target is balance-based meaning only{" "}

          contribute to the profit earned on an account. Open positions{" "}
