      ans: `The Profit Target represents the amount of profit you need to reach during a specific Phase of the Challenge.<br/><br/>
      It is determined based on the profit earned from closed positions, meaning any currently open trades do not count toward the Profit Target.<br/><br/>
      To advance to Phase 2 and ultimately qualify for the Funded stage, you must close all active positions. For instance, if you achieve a 10% profit in Phase 1, you have successfully met the Profit Target. However, in the next Phase, you will begin again from a fresh starting point.<br/><br/>
      Our goal is to ensure traders meet profit targets through disciplined and consistent trading. To maintain this standard, we do not allow passing the Challenge through a single oversized trade or by placing multiple trades on the same asset in the same direction if they collectively contribute more than 70% of the Profit Target. Such approaches do not provide enough data to accurately assess your skill and trading consistency, which are key factors in our evaluation process.`,

      Your Empire Accounts are deemed inactive and subject to breach if no activity (trade taken) occurs for a period of 30 days. This period starts right after the purchase of the challenge.<br/><br/>
      We reserve the right to close accounts that engage in minimal trading solely to avoid inactivity penalties. Our platform is designed for traders who show consistent engagement and a well-founded trading approach.`,
